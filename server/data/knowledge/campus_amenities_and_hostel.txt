"Life at GVP is so much fun! 🌈 We have separate hostels for boys and girls that feel just like home. 🏠 The canteen serves the yummiest tiffins (you have to try the dosa! 🍛). We also have a huge library for your quiet study time 📚 and a sports ground where you can play and stay fit! 🏀 Let's make some great memories together!"
